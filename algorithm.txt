Diktel Multiple Campus (DMC), established in 2037 B.S. affiliated to
Tribhruvan University, is the first educational leading institute in
Khotang district. The then educators, social workers, guardians,
politicians, well-wishers had established it with theirs’ joint
efforts to offer educational services to the people of Khotang and its
neighbouring districts. It is a non-profit oriented public campus,
located at Diktel headquarter of Khotang district.

It is known to all that the development process of the country depends
with the educational program, plan, policy and system adopted by the
state. It is therefore, state is making large investment in school
education and constituent campus rather than public campuses. On the
otherhand, private campuses make theirs program, plan and implement as
Theirs own wishes. So, both governmental and private campuses are
physically and financially far stronger than public campuses. Along
with the impacts of globalization, the demand of competent human
resources has been increasing rapidly through-out the world. In this
context, the need of quality education has been obligatorily realized.
The government is adopting the policy- how can theoretical knowledge
be transferred to pedagogical knowledge associating to modern
technology?  This is a challenging task to accomplish for the public
campus that are physically and financially poor. Instead of these
challenges, DMC is heading ahead with the supports and participation
of stakeholders to achieve the quality education through physical,
social and economic development. I hope, DMC will get kind support and
co-operation in the coming days.

Diktel Multiple Campus has been conducting B.A., B.Ed., One year B.Ed.
and B.B.S. program in Bachelor Level, and M.A. (Nepali and Sociology),
M.Ed. (Nepali and EPM) in semester system.  In order to offer quality
education and all-round development of campus, it has prepared plan to
extend further programs. Furthermore, DMC has been selected to involve
in QAA program under the supervision of UGC with well co-operation and
participation of all stakeholders.

Finally, I would be grateful, if I got constructive suggestions from
my well-wishers/ stakeholders.  I do promise that I will attempt to
transfer campus in to a good learning center with well – equipped
technology.

Thanks ….
